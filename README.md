# WordFall and SpaceCube privacy policy
I collect no personal data from WordFall or SpaceCube, unless it is shared accidentally with me. In fact, I would collect 0 data at all, but there is some data monitoring built into the Google Play store that I cannot opt out of. So here are the ways I accidentally do save your information. 

# User Feedback

When you leave comments, I can see what device you used to make the comment, the version of android you were using and the version of the app you were using. Please don't let this sway you from making comments. I love your comments. 

# Data aggregation

When you install SpaceCube or WordFall, I can see where in the world you installed it from, whether it was from the USA or from the Not USA. There have been times in the past that I've had as many as 2 SpaceCube installs in the same day!

# Emails

When you directly email me about SpaceCube or WordFall, I am able to view your email address from which you messaged me. This data gets saved in my email archive, and does not typically get deleted. Do not send me emails unless you are comfortable with me knowing your email address. If you did send me an email and would to have it deleted, please me an email asking me to delete the email, and I will delete the email that you asked me to delete as well as the email you sent to tell me to delete the email. 

# Summary
Seriously, I don't collect any information. Both of these apps are really dumb and I just made them for fun.
